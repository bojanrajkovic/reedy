# Reedy

Reedy is an iPhone backup reader &amp; extractor. It reads unencrypted 
iPhone backups produced by iTunes and allows you to extract
any file from the backup.

# Building

You'll need VS 2015+, any edition should do. Reedy is written in plain
C# with a single PCL and WPF project, so it should be as simple as:

1. Clone
2. Open Reedy.sln
3. Hit Build
